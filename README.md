# expenses-calculator
A small Android app that allows the user to sum their monthly incomes and expenses, and updates the expected monthly balance

The app is in the early stages of development, it is not ready to be forked yet.

Things I want to add to the app:
1. summation of incomes/expenses for a given time (month, week etc.).
2. calculating averages of incomes and expenses.
3. fixing regular incomes (salaries) or expenses (rent, bills) to every month.
4. display according to months, and swiping through them.
5. breakdown of incomes/expenses by date.
6. averages and data manipulation by date breakdown.
